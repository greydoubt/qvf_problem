# qvf_problem
the Q vs F problem

Can a COMPUTATIONAL DEVICE (aka a digital Cynthos) detect if a point particle is a QUEEF or a FART?

DEFINITIONS:

QUEEF: if the jet is exiting a large cavity through a small and thin oriﬁce, a spherical symmetry is expected


FART: If the jet is coming out of a long cylindrical tube, one expects an axially symmetric ﬂow
